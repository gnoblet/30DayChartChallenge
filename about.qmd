## About the 30 Day Chart Challenge

The #30DayChartChallenge is a community-driven data visualization challenge that runs every April. Participants create one chart per day based on a set of prompts organized into different categories.

## The Challenge

Each day has a specific prompt that guides the creation of a visualization. The prompts are organized into categories such as "comparisons," "distributions," "relationships," and more. This structure encourages participants to explore different types of data visualization and improve their skills across various domains.

## My Approach

For this challenge, I primarily used:

- **R** with packages like ggplot2, patchwork, and sf for most visualizations
- **Python** with libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for specific days
- Various data sources including open data repositories, APIs, and self-collected data

## Conversion to Quarto Website

This website was created by converting individual R scripts to Quarto documents. Quarto provides an excellent way to combine code, visualizations, and narrative in a cohesive document. The website makes all visualizations and code accessible in one place.
