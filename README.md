# 30DayChartChallenge

[![Quarto Publish](https://github.com/gnoblet/30DayChartChallenge/actions/workflows/quarto-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gnoblet/30DayChartChallenge/actions/workflows/quarto-publish.yml)

## About
This repository contains my submissions for the #30DayChartChallenge, a community-driven data visualization challenge that runs every April. Participants create one chart per day based on a set of prompts organized into different categories.

## Website
The charts are published as a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/) using GitHub Pages. You can view the website [here](#).

## Structure
- `2025/`: Contains the individual Quarto documents for each day's chart
- `data/`: Contains datasets used for the visualizations if needed (not included in the git repository)
- `images/`: Contains static images and resources
- `.github/workflows/`: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
