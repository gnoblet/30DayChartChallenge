I cannot generate binary files like PNG images directly. Instead, I can suggest creating a simple favicon.png file using a different approach:

1. You can use an online favicon generator like https://favicon.io/
2. You can create a simple PNG with a data visualization icon or a simple chart symbol
3. Save the file manually to 30DayChartChallenge/images/favicon.png

For a placeholder, you could also use a text file with instructions for creating a favicon and rename it later once you have the actual image file.
